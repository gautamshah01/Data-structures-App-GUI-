 <h1>Introduction</h1>


The Data Structures App is an interactive GUI application built with Python's tkinter library. Its primary goal is to facilitate the understanding and visualization of various data structures, making it an excellent educational resource for students and enthusiasts. Each data structure is implemented within its own dedicated GUI class, allowing users to explore and interact with them effectively.

<h1>Features</h1>

•	Full-Screen Mode: Provides an immersive experience, maximizing the use of screen space for visualizations.

•	Modular Design: Each data structure is encapsulated in its own class, promoting organized code and ease of maintenance.

•	Custom Styling: A cohesive color scheme and typography enhance the visual appeal of the application, making it user-friendly.

•	Background Image: Users can personalize their experience with a customizable background image.

•	Exit Confirmation: Prevents accidental closure by prompting users for confirmation before exiting.



<h1>Data Structure Features</h1>

Stack

•	LIFO Principle: Operates on the Last In, First Out principle.

•	Key Operations: Push (add), Pop (remove), Peek (view top element).

•	Use Cases: Function call management, expression evaluation.


Queue


•	FIFO Principle: Follows the First In, First Out principle.

•	Key Operations: Enqueue (add), Dequeue (remove), Peek (view front element).

•	Use Cases: Print job scheduling, task management.


Priority Queue

•	Priority-Based: Elements are dequeued based on assigned priorities.


•	Key Operations: Insert (add with priority), Extract Max/Min (remove based on priority).


•	Use Cases: Job scheduling in operating systems, Dijkstra’s algorithm for pathfinding.


Linked List


•	Dynamic Structure: Composed of nodes, each pointing to the next.


•	Key Operations: Insert (add node), Delete (remove node), Traverse (iterate through nodes).


•	Use Cases: Efficient memory usage, implementation of stacks and queues.


Doubly Linked List


•	Two References: Each node has pointers to both next and previous nodes.


•	Key Operations: Insert, Delete, Bidirectional Traverse.


•	Use Cases: Navigation systems, complex data structure implementations.


Binary Tree


•	Hierarchical Structure: Each node can have up to two children.


•	Key Operations: Insert, Delete, Traverse (in-order, pre-order, post-order).


•	Use Cases: Organizing hierarchical data, binary search trees.


Huffman Coding


•	Data Compression: Uses variable-length codes based on character frequencies.


•	Key Operations: Encoding and Decoding.


•	Use Cases: File compression in formats like ZIP and JPEG.


Graph


•	Node Connections: Composed of vertices and edges, can be directed or undirected.


•	Key Operations: Add Vertex, Add Edge, Traverse (DFS, BFS).


•	Use Cases: Social networks, route optimization.


Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP)


•	Optimization Problem: Seeks the shortest route visiting all given cities.


•	Key Operations: Route Calculation using various algorithms.


•	Use Cases: Logistics, circuit design.


Hash Table


•	Key-Value Storage: Allows fast data retrieval based on keys.


•	Key Operations: Insert (add key-value pair), Delete, Search.


•	Use Cases: Database indexing, efficient data retrieval.


<h1>Dependencies</h1>h1>


•	tkinter: Essential for creating the GUI components.


•	Pillow (PIL): Used for image processing and background handling.


<h1>Code Overview</h1>    


The MainGUI class is central to the application, managing the main window and navigation. Key methods include:


•	__init__: Initializes the application, setting up the window and styles.


•	start_screen(): Displays the initial welcome interface with options to start or exit.


•	open_main_gui(): Transitions to the main interface upon user selection.


•	create_sidebar(): Constructs the sidebar with buttons for each data structure, facilitating navigation.


•	clear_window(): Clears the current window to prepare for new content.


<h1>Usage</h1>


To use the Data Structures App:


1.	Run the Application: Execute the Python script to launch the app in full-screen mode.


2.	Navigate: Click "Start" to access the main interface and select data structures from the sidebar.


3.	Exit: Click "Exit" and confirm to close the application.


<h1>Customization</h1>


•	Background Image: Users can replace background.jpg to change the app’s appearance.


•	Color Scheme: Modify the color variables in the __init__ method for a personalized look.


•	Fonts: Adjust font styles in the application to suit individual preferences.


<h1>Conclusion</h1>


The Data Structures App is an effective educational tool that enables users to visualize and interact with key data structures. Its modular design, customization options, and user-friendly interface make it an excellent resource for learners and educators alike, enhancing understanding of fundamental computer science concepts.
